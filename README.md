Personal configuration files. These configs have come from various sources.
I have tried to allude the sources at appropriate places. 
If anything has been left out, it's due to my negligence, feel free to point out.

## Installation
$`make install`
although its recommended to run `make dry-run` before installing
to check everything will work as expected.

## Uninstall
$ `make uninstall`
